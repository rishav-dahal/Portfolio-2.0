# Google AdSense Approval Checklist for 2026

Getting Google AdSense approval in 2026 is less about perfect traffic and more about proving your site is a high-quality, professional resource. Approval standards are strict, so following a clear checklist helps reduce the chance of **Low Value Content** or **Policy Violation** rejection.

## 1) Essential Pages (Trust Signals)

Before applying, make sure these pages are visible in your header or footer. Without them, your site can look incomplete or untrustworthy.

- **Privacy Policy**: Explain how you handle user data, cookies, and analytics.
- **About Us**: Clearly describe who you are and what value your site provides.
- **Contact Us**: Add a working contact form or professional email address.
- **Terms and Conditions**: Optional, but strongly recommended for professionalism.

## 2) Content Quality (Most Common Rejection Area)

Google’s standards prioritize genuinely helpful content.

- **Quantity**: Aim for around **15–20 high-quality posts** before applying.
- **Length**: Keep most posts in the **800–1,200+ word** range.
- **Originality**: Avoid generic AI fluff. If you use AI for research, add your own insights, examples, and experience.
- **Niche Focus**: Stick to one clear topic to build topical authority.
- **Formatting**: Use proper `H1`, `H2`, and `H3` structure, bullets, and original images.

## 3) Technical & User Experience

If the site is hard to use, approval chances drop.

- **Custom Domain**: Prefer your own domain (`.com`, `.org`, etc.).
- **Mobile Friendly**: Use a responsive theme and test on mobile screens.
- **Navigation**: Keep menus clean and remove broken or incomplete pages.
- **Speed**: Improve load time with image optimization and caching.
- **SSL/HTTPS**: Ensure your site is fully secure.

## 4) Traffic & Indexing

You don’t need huge traffic, but your site should show real activity.

- **Google Search Console**: Submit your domain and XML sitemap.
- **Indexing Check**: Confirm key pages are indexed and discoverable.
- **Organic Visits**: Even modest real search traffic helps signal usefulness.
- **Avoid Fake Traffic**: Never use bots or traffic-buying schemes.

## 5) Prohibited Content (Instant Rejection Risks)

Make sure your site does **not** include:

- Adult or sexually explicit content.
- Pirated or copyrighted material.
- Hate speech or illegal activity promotion.
- Thin pages with very little useful text.

## If You Get “Low Value Content” Rejection

Usually this means content is too short, too generic, or too similar to what already exists online.

Try this before reapplying:

- Publish 4–6 deeper articles (around 1,200–1,500+ words).
- Add unique visuals, examples, and practical insights.
- Improve internal linking and page structure.
- Wait about 2 weeks, then reapply.
