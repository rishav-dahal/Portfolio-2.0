# OCR Code Compiler Project

## Overview

The **OCR Code Compiler** is a project designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for document images. This system leverages advanced pre-processing techniques and intelligent code compilation to provide superior OCR results.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing:** Implements a novel pre-processing approach to enhance the clarity of document images.
- **OCR Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with state-of-the-art OCR libraries to extract text from documents.
- **Code Compilation:** Supports multiple languages for backend processing, including Python, C++, and Java, ensuring optimal performance for OCR tasks.

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to improve OCR accuracy, particularly for documents with complex layouts or degraded quality, through intelligent image pre-processing and powerful code compilation techniques.

## How It Works

1. **Pre-Processing:** The uploaded document image goes through a series of pre-processing steps to enhance its quality.
2. **OCR:** The enhanced image is passed to an OCR engine for text extraction.
3. **Code Compilation:** The OCR process is optimized using compiled code in Python, C++, or Java, depending on the requirements of the task.

## Technologies Used

- **OCR Engine:** Tesseract OCR (or similar)
- **Backend:** Python, C++, Java (MSVC compiler for C++)
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Preprocessing Tools:** Custom image pre-processing algorithms

## Purpose

The OCR Code Compiler project is aimed at developers and researchers who need high-accuracy OCR for scanned documents, forms, or reports. It offers a robust solution for handling a variety of image qualities and layouts.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional languages
- Real-time OCR processing
- Integration with cloud storage for easy document access and processing

## Try It Out

You can test the OCR Code Compiler on the demo page. Simply upload a document image, and the system will process it using the latest OCR techniques, delivering high-quality text extraction results.
